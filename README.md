# Blog: Journey of Building WeRemote.ge - A Remote Job Board

## Entry 1: The Genesis

It all started with an idea to simplify the search for remote jobs and create a seamless platform for employers to find the perfect candidates. The concept was clear: develop a website where users could easily browse remote job listings and apply directly. Employers would have the ability to post jobs, making the platform a central hub for remote work opportunities.

## Entry 2: Laying the Groundwork

The initial steps involved choosing the right tech stack. We decided on React for the frontend to create a responsive and dynamic user experience. For the backend, Node.js was an obvious choice for its efficiency and compatibility with our database choice, MongoDB. Setting up the local development environment was crucial, as it allowed for smooth progression through development phases.

## Entry 3: Backend Development

Developing the backend involved setting up MongoDB with proper schemas for job postings. This was essential for storing and retrieving job data efficiently. We also tackled API development, creating endpoints that would later connect seamlessly with our frontend.

## Entry 4: Frontend Flair

The frontend work was all about user interaction. React components were meticulously crafted to ensure users could interact with job listings and filters intuitively. We also emphasized the design, aiming for a clean and accessible user interface that would appeal to a wide audience.

## Entry 5: Feature Integration

One of the most satisfying parts of the project was implementing search functionality. It allowed users to filter jobs based on various criteria such as role, company, and tags. We also introduced form validation to ensure data integrity before submissions reached the backend.

## Entry 6: Deployment Dilemmas

Deployment brought its own set of challenges. Configuring AWS S3 for hosting was straightforward, but the DNS settings for our domain, WeRemote.ge, proved tricky. There were moments of frustration when the site wasn’t reachable due to DNS misconfigurations, but resolving these issues was a learning curve. As well, learning to connect the front end to the back end (using Elastic Beanstalk,  subnets, VPCs, NAT Gateways) was  definitely a memorable experience.

## Entry 7: Going Live

The excitement of going live was palpable. After ensuring all configurations were correct and that the build folder was properly set up, we finally launched. It was rewarding to see our project accessible on the web at www.weremote.ge.

## Entry 8: Reflections and Future Plans

Looking back at the journey, from brainstorming sessions to debugging and deployment, each phase taught us something new. The platform isn’t just a product; it’s a testament to our dedication and hard work. As we plan for future enhancements, including payment integrations and more advanced filtering options, our initial journey continues to inspire and guide us.
